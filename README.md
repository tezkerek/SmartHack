A web app that safely stores secrets, using AES-256 encryption. The data is
encrypted client-side with a key derived from the login password, and so only
the user can decrypt the entries.

The app can also generate passwords based on user-configurable parameters
(length, include digits, include symbols) and symmetric/asymmetric keys (RSA,
Ed25519, AES, 3DES).

The project was developed for the [SmartHack](https://smarthack.asmi.ro/) 2021
student hackathon and won 1st place.
